## Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a command-line implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid.
## How to Run
1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC).
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Compile the C++ source code by executing the following command:

``` 
g++ main.cpp -o tictactoe
```
5. Run the program with the following command
```
./tictactoe
```
## How to Play
1. The game board is represented as a 3x3 grid, with each cell numbered from 1 to 9.
2. Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the number of the cell they want to mark.
3. Player 1 uses "X" as their marker, and Player 2 uses "O".
4. To make a move, enter the corresponding cell number when prompted.
5. The game ends when one player wins by getting three of their markers in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all cells are filled without a winner (a draw).
